# ðŸŽ± Balls to the Walls

A fun and colorful JavaScript animation featuring three bouncing balls that collide with each other and the canvas walls.  
Built using HTML5 Canvas and a touch of jQuery for setup.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

- HTML5
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- jQuery & jQuery UI
- HTML5 Canvas API

## ðŸ§  How It Works

- Three balls (blue, red, orange) are animated inside a canvas.
- Each ball bounces off the edges.
- If two balls get close enough, they "collide" and bounce off each other (direction is reversed).
- Simple distance-based collision detection logic.
